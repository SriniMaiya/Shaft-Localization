The project proposes a deep-learning methodology to solve the problem of [Bin-Picking](https://www.ipa.fraunhofer.de/en/expertise/robot-and-assistive-systems/intralogistics-and-material-flow/separation-processes-using-robots-bin-picking.html) in industries, a core problem in the computer vision domain.
