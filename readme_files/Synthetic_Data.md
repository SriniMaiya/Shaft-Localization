# Synthetic-data creation with Belnder and Blender-Python(bpy)

* 3D model of shafts were created with suitable texture to replicate the real-world scenario.
* Creation of Blender-Python script to automate the data creation. The images were created with:
    1. Varying number of shafts
    2. Variyng illumination conditions   
* Only the annotations of the shafts are saved, which are on the top layer( termed as pickable)
